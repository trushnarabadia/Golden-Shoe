# Golden-Shoe

## [Planning & Mind-Mapping](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOFBHPnM=/)

First of all, I started by creating a mind-map of the features and functions I would like the new Golden Shoe website to incorporate. I've included a screen shot of the mind-map below.

I then organised the ideas into categories of which features/ideas link together.

After having done this, I decided on the solution I wanted to work on - the checkout process. I will first need to build the basic section and then move onto the checkout.
